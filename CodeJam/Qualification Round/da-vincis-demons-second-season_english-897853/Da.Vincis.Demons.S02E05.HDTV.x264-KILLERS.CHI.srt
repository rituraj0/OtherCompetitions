a holy fool for coming here.

179
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,461
I had no other choice.

180
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,297
Gallus and Daphnis?

181
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:35,499
The names of the lovers
in Eclogue Ten.

182
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:38,102
I knew you would remember.

183
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,104
How could I forget?

184
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:44,141
On the banks of the River Po,
reading all Virgil's verses.

185
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,446
We rarely finished.

186
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,882
And to think I lost you...

187
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:58,255
to that Roman woman
and the Orsini name.

188
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:02,126
Clarice... has her virtues.

189
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:05,329
Ah. Do you read poetry together?

190
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:11,469
As we speak,

191
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:14,505
she watches over my Republic

192
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:17,475
as your husband brandishes
arms against it.

193
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,310
I tried.

194
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,812
I pleaded for him not
to move against you.

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,814
After the attack
on your family...

196
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,850
Poor Giuliano.

197
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,919
I cannot bear
the thought of Alfonso

198
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,688
bringing more death to Florence.

199
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:31,989
Your husband is a warrior.

200
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,024
He takes up weapons
as automatically

201
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:35,860
as a child handles a plaything.

202
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,163
That is why we are here, Your
Grace, to speak with King Ferrante.

203
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:40,998
My father-in-law
will not listen.

204
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,199
He is...

205
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:44,235
Just like a Florentine,

206
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:46,270
to enter from the back door.

207
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:47,438
Alfonso.

208
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:50,007
Lorenzo has come to meet
with your father.

209
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:52,910
I had hoped to act
as an intermediary.

210
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:54,478
Of course.

211
00:13:54,546 --> 00:14:00,417
That must be why you came
here without a royal escort.

212
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,453
It wasn't her idea, Alfonso.

213
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:06,257
I called upon her to...
come to me alone.

214
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:09,727
You dare enter
Naples unannounced

215
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,695
and meet with my wife in secret?

216
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:16,767
Alfonso, I... Duke Alfonso.

217
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:21,005
I...implore you...

218
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:27,077
let me sit with your father
and end this pointless war.

219
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:33,317
Of course.

220
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:36,487
Of course I will take
you to my father.

221
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:41,325
We are...
civilized heads of state.

222
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:42,927
Are we not?

223

I'm at your mercy, my lady.

225
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,855
I only seek a discussion
away from prying ears.

226
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:14,191
And what if someone
saw you enter?

227
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:16,493
I took precautions.

228
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,762
I would never risk your dignity.

229
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:28,472
Henbane, bark of mandrake
and juice of lettuce.

230
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,143
An ineffective potion
against the restless sleep of leadership.

231
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,778
But a necessary one.

232
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,814
Other leaders of this
family have found relief

233
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,041
in distractions of the flesh.

234
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,218
I need no schooling
in my husband's habits.

235
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:42,753
What do you want?

236
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:46,390
To offer assistance
with Portinari and Sassetti.

237
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,459
Their scheming is obvious.

238
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,928
I need no help with greedy
jackals, I grew up in Rome.

239
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:52,322
I wish to make sure they

240
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:54,832
take no advantage
of what they perceive as weakness.

241
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,201
They were trained by my father.

242
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:01,505
Cosimo demanded a certain
ruthlessness in those he employed.

243
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:04,975
And I will gladly
respond in kind.

244
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:10,814
Consider their perspective.

245
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,150
They believe the bank weak
with a woman at it's head,

246
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:16,487
akin to how my father denied
me a place in it's management.

247
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:18,555
You were illegitimate.

248
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:20,057

250

Almost as bad as being a woman.

251
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,502
So you'd like an alliance...

252
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:36,373
a seat on the Medici Bank
board after all these years.

253
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:39,410
